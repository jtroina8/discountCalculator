Practicing JavaScript and React Native.

Creating a calulator is always a ground level project, so I figured I'd start with it. 

I tried to put a background image instead of a solid color, but it didn't work on first attempt, so I discarded the idea. I'll impliment that in a future project. This was about reviewing the basics.
